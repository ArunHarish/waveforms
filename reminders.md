* React Router query params for each section (to be read on pageload as well)
* Mobile: Crashes when toggling sound sometimes?
* Mobile: IntersectionObserver not cutting it, doesn't fire until scroll ends :(
* Mobile: Bigger slider handles
* Mobile: padding fixes, horizontal scroll :(

* Safari: Page jumps a bit on section change.
* Safari: No WaveformAddition waves showing up :(
* Safari: Keyboard shortcuts don't work

* First volume-adjust fails

* IntersectionObserver to fire when the next step reaches the middle of the screen, rather than when the current one exits?
* Move waveformaddition stuff to IntroRoute, since Oscillator needs access to it (so that we can play all these fancy new sounds)
* Update oscillator to handle multi-oscillator.
