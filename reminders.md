* React Router query params for each section (to be read on pageload as well)
* Mobile: Crashes when toggling sound sometimes?
* Mobile: Bigger slider handles
* Mobile: padding fixes, horizontal scroll :(

* Safari: Page jumps a bit on section change.

- IntersectionObserver to fire when the next step reaches the middle of the screen, rather than when the current one exits?
