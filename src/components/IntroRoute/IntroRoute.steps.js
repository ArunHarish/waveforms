          Next, let's look at <strong>frequency</strong>.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The waveform we've been looking at is of a <em>sine wave</em>. This
          refers to the "shape" of the line in the waveform graph. The sine wave
          is "periodic": This means that the wave repeats.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Waveforms are windows into a wave over a specific amount of time. In
          this case, our waveform covers two "periods" of a sine wave.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Important to note: The amount of time hasn't changed. This is still 1
          second of audio. We've just squeezed two periods of the sine wave into
          our waveform, instead of 1.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The number of periods per second is known as the frequency. The unit
          of measurement is called the Hertz (abbreviated as 'Hz'). The wave
          over there is 2Hz, since the waveform repeats twice.

          Frequency is just the technical term for "pitch". For example, When
          you sing an "A4" note (The "A" in the middle of a typical piano), your
          throat vibrates at 440Hz.

            For sound to be audible, it needs to be much faster than this: the
            human hearing range is from 20Hz to 20,000Hz.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            The frequencies in this guide use slower frequencies to keep the
            numbers and visualizations simpler, since the concepts are more
            important than the specific frequencies.

          To help us understand, the waveform on the left now has a blue circle
          that follows the changes in amplitude over time. Because we're using a

          The grid on the left below the waveform represents a bunch of air
          molecules floating in the air. Notice how the molecules themselves
          aren't travelling through the air; the wave travels by causing a
          rippling effect through the air molecules.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          This is similar to what happens when you throw a stone in a smooth
          pond. Waves radiate outwards, but the actual water molecules don't
          move from the center out; the wave ripples through the water.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Ever notice how, when you blast a song from a speaker, you can see the
          speaker cone vibrating? Speakers work by kicking off this chain
          reaction of vibrations.

          In terms of harmonics, the square wave features exactly the same
          intervals as the triangle wave: Every "odd" harmonic (3rd, 5th, 7th,
          etc). The difference between the square and the triangle is that the
          square's harmonics are louder: they don't fall off so quickly, so you
          get more higher frequencies. This is plainly noticeable in the sound:
          squares sound much "brighter" than triangles.

            Unlike the previous two waveforms, a perfect square wave is
            impossible; it cannot exist in nature, we can only approximate it.
            Can you think of why that might be?

              Remember, the waveform represents the displacement of air
              molecules. Molecules cannot "teleport" from the +1 position to the
              -1 position. In reality, when a square wave is played through a
              speaker, it causes the air to move very quickly from both
              positions, but it is not instantaneous.

          In terms of sound, it's vaguely similar to string instruments: when
          you run a bow across a violin's string, the friction between the two
          items causes the string to slip and catch, which causes the string to
          vibrate in a sawtooth-like pattern. Of course, real instruments
          produce far more complex waveforms than these basic ones!

          In the previous section, we learned about how different waveforms have
          different harmonics, but it's totally unclear <em>why</em> that's the
          case. For example, why does a square wave have all those extra tones
          when we're still just oscillating at a single frequency?
        </Paragraph>

          To make sense of this, there's a surprising truth about waveforms:{' '}
          <strong>
            all of them can be built by just layering a bunch of sine waves on
            top of each other.

          or sawtooth?

          If you've ever used audio editing software, you've seen how a full
          song - which is comprised of many different instruments and sounds -
          creates a single wave. What we're looking at over there is not a wave
          yet: we have to combine the 3 lines into 1.

          This is known as <strong>waveform addition</strong>, and it makes
          sense when you think of it in real-world terms.

          Remember, sound is just the vibration of air molecules. If you play 3
          distinct tones, you don't get 3 separate air molecules vibrating at 3
          separate frequencies; the 3 tones combine to form a single waveform.

          How does the addition work? It's arithmetic: in our example, amplitude
          ranges from -1dB to 0dB. So, we can just add up the values. The 3
          waves will converge at a single point for every moment in time.

          You were probably wondering where those numbers for the additional
